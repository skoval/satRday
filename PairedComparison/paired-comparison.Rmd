# Sport Competition

Whether it's two individuals or two teams, most sport competition comes down to a paired comparison.

---

# Win Ability

- The 'comparison' of main interest in sport is a competitors ability to win

- How competitors have fared against each other gives us the most direct information about their respective win abilities

- The family of `paired comparison models` are useful tools for estimating that ability

---

# Question: Abilities

- Suppose we have two competitors who are going to face each other

- Further suppose we know that Competitor A has ability $\delta_A$ and Competitor B has ability $\delta_B$ 

- What properties of $\delta_A$ and $\delta_B$ would make us favor one competitor over another?

--

Answer: We should favor the competitor with greater ability.

# Bradley-Terry-Luce

.cbox[
### One of the most popular paired comparison models is the Bradley-Terry-Luce model.
]

- Bradley-Terry-Luce encapsulates the idea that competition results tell us about the underlying abilities of the competitors.

- Relative ability is modeled as a logistic function of wins:

<br>

$$
P(Win_A = 1) = \frac{\exp{(\delta_A - \delta_B)}}{1 + \exp{(\delta_A - \delta_B)}}
$$

---

# BTL Properties

- Win expectations all come down to the difference in abilities

- An equal difference, $\delta_A - \delta_B$, implies the same win expectation no matter the individual abilities of $A$ and $B$

- Expectations are even when $\delta_A -\delta_B = 0$

- Roughly +10% for every added difference in ability of 0.4

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
BT <- function(delta){
  exp(delta) / (1 + exp(delta))
}

data <- data.frame(
  ability = seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1),
  p = BT(seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1))
)

data %>%
ggplot(aes(y = p * 100, x = ability)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, col = "#1792d0") +
  geom_line(size = 2, col = "#1792d0") +
  theme_hc() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, col = "red") + 
  scale_y_continuous("BTL Win Expectation", breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + 
  scale_x_continuous("Ability Difference", breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))
```

---

# BTL in R

- `BradleyTerry2` (authors Turner and Firth) is an R package for fitting BTL models

- It uses maximum-likelihood to estimate competitor abilities

- It can incorporate covariates

- Other binary families can also be fit

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("BradleyTerry2")
```

---

# Function BTm

The main workhorse function for the BTL model is `BTm`. Here is the general syntax:

```{r eval = F}
BTm(outcome, player1, player2, ...)
```

- `outcome` is with respect to `player1`

- `player1` must be a factor with same levels as `player2`

- `player2` must be a factor with same levels as `player1`

Note: The `outcome` is with respect to `player1`.

# English Premier League

We can download the current standings for the EPL from the [www.football-data.co.uk](www.football-data.co.uk)

```{r}
football <- "http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1718/E0.csv"

data <- read.csv(football, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

---

# EPL Data

Each row is a summary of a particular EPL game. The variables of interest are:

- HomeTeam: The name of the home team

- AwayTeam: The name of the away team

- FTHG: Goals scored by home team

- FTAG: Goals scored by away team

---

# Example: Basic BTL

Below we derive an indicator for wins and losses and then fit a BTL using the `BTm` function.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(BradleyTerry2)

data <- data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    outcome = as.numeric(FTHG > FTAG),
    HomeTeam = factor(HomeTeam, levels = unique(c(HomeTeam, AwayTeam))),
    AwayTeam = factor(AwayTeam, levels = levels(HomeTeam))
  )



fit <- BTm(outcome, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, 
           data = data)
```

---

# BTm Methods

The result of `BTm` has all of the standard methods of `glm` models.

- `print` : Model summary and point estimates of coefficients


- `summary`: More detailed summary of estimates (including standard errors)

- `plots`: Residual diagnostic plots

---


# Abilities

A useful function for extracting the abilities on the log scale is with the function `BTabilities`.

```{r}
abilities <- BTabilities(fit) # Matrix of ability and StdErr

abilities <- data.frame(
  Team = rownames(abilities),
  Ability = abilities[,1],
  SE = abilities[,2]
)

abilities$Team <- factor(abilities$Team, 
                        levels = abilities$Team[order(abilities$Ability)],
                        order = T)
```

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
abilities %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = Ability, ymin = Ability - 2 * SE, ymax = Ability + 2 * SE, x = Team)) + 
  geom_pointrange(col = "#e5952c") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_hc() + theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Abilities") + 
  scale_x_discrete("") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red") + 
  ggtitle("EPL Team Abilities - 2017/2018")
```

---

# Question

What are some of the shortcomings of our current model?

--

Some possibilities:

- No home/away advantage

- We treat ties as losses for Home team

---

# Home Advantage

It is generally thought that a team gets a boost in their win expectations when playing at home. 

To introduce a home advantage covariate, we need to restructure our dataset and add a covariate for each team factor. 

```{r}
data$Home <- data.frame(
  Team = data$HomeTeam, 
  at.home = 1
)

data$Away <- data.frame(
  Team = data$AwayTeam, 
  at.home = 0
)
```

---

# Home Advantage BTL

Now we add the home advantage covariate (`at.home`) to the model, using the `formula` statement.


```{r}
fit <- BTm(outcome, Home, Away, 
           data = data,
           id = "Team", 
           formula = ~ Team + at.home
           )
```

---

# Problem

1. What does the `at.home` effect suggest about the home advantage in the 2017-2018 EPL?

2. How do the abilities change compared to our previous fit without this advantage?

---

# Solution: Home Advantage Estimate

```{r}
summary(fit)$coef["at.home",]
```

---

# Solution: Change In Abilities

```{r echo = F}
abilities2 <- BTabilities(fit) # Matrix of ability and StdErr

abilities2 <- data.frame(
  Team = rownames(abilities2),
  Ability = abilities2[,1],
  SE = abilities2[,2]
)

abilities$Type <- "Without Home Adv"
abilities2$Type <- "With Home Adv"

order <- levels(abilities$Team)

abilities <- rbind(abilities, abilities2)

abilities$Team <- factor(abilities$Team, 
                        levels = order,
                        order = T)

abilities %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = Ability, ymin = Ability - 2 * SE, ymax = Ability + 2 * SE, x = Team)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(col = Type, group = Type), position = position_dodge(0.1)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_colour_tableau(name = "") + 
  theme_hc() + theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Abilities") + 
  scale_x_discrete("") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red") + 
  ggtitle("EPL Team Abilities - 2017/2018")
```

---

# Reverse Home Advantage?

- Our results suggest that playing at home is actually a _disadvantage_.

- This goes against all conventional thinking!

- Could we have made a mistake somewhere?

---

# Problem: Ties

We have treated ties (or draws) as losses for the home team. Have a look at the frequency of ties in the EPL data. Could our assumption be a problem?


---

# Solution: Frequency of Ties


```{r eval = FALSE}
data$ties <- data$FTHG == data$FTAG

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ties)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#e5952c") +
  theme_hc()
```

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
data$ties <- data$FTHG == data$FTAG

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ties)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#e5952c") +
  theme_hc()
```

---

# Problem: Effect of Ties

- Fit a BTm + Home advantage excluding matches with ties

- Determine the estimate of the home advantage

- What do you conclude about the importance of handling ties for our model?

---

# Solution: Effect of Ties

```{r}
data$Home <- data$Away <- NULL

data <- data %>% filter(!ties)

data$Home <- data.frame(
  Team = data$HomeTeam, 
  at.home = 1
)

data$Away <- data.frame(
  Team = data$AwayTeam, 
  at.home = 0
)

fit <- BTm(outcome, Home, Away, 
           data = data,
           id = "Team", 
           formula = ~ Team + at.home
           )

summary(fit)$coef["at.home",]
```

# Publishing

### One of the most popular and quick ways of sharing your ideas with the world is through *blogging*.

# Getting There

--

- Starting a blog might seem overwhelming but, if you know `R` and some basic CSS, it's easy

--

- Producing interesting content is the tough part about blogging

--

- `R` helps to let you focus on _content_ by providing easy-to-use tools that solve the technical details of going from code to the Web

# About Hugo

* Hugo works with any operating system in the same way

* It handles many pages of content efficiently

* Hugo (like `R`) also has a very active user community

* *However*, Hugo is intended only for static sites where HTML content is fixed no matter what the user behavior

---

# Key Functions

Here are the major functions you will use with `blogdown`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
	Function = c(
	"install_hugo",
	"install_theme",
	"build_site",
	"html_page",
	"hugo_cmd",
	"new_content",
	"new_site",
	"serve_site"
	),
	Description = c(
		"Downloads and installs Hugo",

		"Renders an Rmd file as an HTML that can be read by Hugo",
		"Run Hugo commands",
		"Creates new file in working directory",

	)
)


htmlTable(data, 
          rnames = F, 
          col.rgroup = c("#fff", "#eeeeee"),
          align = "ll",
          css.cell = "padding:2%;")
```

# Example Workflow

1. Create a repo for your blog on Github (you need to have an account). Here is my example:

<div align="center">
<img src="github.png" width=80%>
</div>

---

# Example Workflow


2. Choose a directory for your repo and clone it there. Here, I put my repo under the path `/Software`:

<br>

---

# Set Server Daemon

--

- By default, when running your site locally, your `R` session will be blocked

--

- To prevent this, you can use change your options `options(servr.daemon = FALSE)`

--

- You can do this at the start of each blogging session 

--

- _Or_ fix it permanently in your `.Rprofile` file

---

# Example Workflow


3. In `R`, load `blogdown`

4. Install Hugo

5. `setwd` into the repo directory and create a new site

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(blogdown)

install_hugo() # On a Mac you need homebrew

options(servr.daemon = FALSE) # If not in Rprofile

# setwd() to blog directory

new_site()
```

---

# Starting Site

You should see a browser open with the following default layout:

![](site_page.png)


---

# Site Folders

Also, if you look under your blog repo, you will see that a number of new folders were created. These are all the elements needed to get your site up and running.

![](site-folders.png)

---


# Choosing a New Theme


* The default theme for the site is `Lithium`

* To set your own style, you can choose from hundreds of other themes
 at [themes.gohugo.io](http://themes.gohugo.io/) 
 
* When you find one you like you can add it to your site with `install_theme`

<div align="center">
<img src="hugo_themes.png" width=50%>
</div>


---

# Example: Install Theme

In this example, I add theme `mainroad`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install_theme('vimux/mainroad',
	theme_example = TRUE, 
	update_config = TRUE
)
```

---

# Example: Install Theme

I can preview the site with the `serve_site` function. Here is what the new theme looks like:

![](mainroad.png)


---

# Configuring Site

In your blog repo, you will see a `config.toml` file. This is where you can update the elements on your main page (which will be `index.html`). Below I've highlighted some fields to update with the `Mainroad` config file.

<div align="center">
<img src="config.png" width=80%>
</div>


---

# New Configuration 

![](config-update.png)

---

# Updated Site

![](site-updates.png)

---

# Creating New Post

You can generate new posts in R markdown (or markdown) files using `new_post`. Here is an example.

```{r eval = FALSE}
new_post(
	title = "French Open 2017",
	kind = "default"
)
```

---

# Creating a New Post

This will open an editor, where you can enter any additional meta-data and start to create content, just like you would with `R` markdown.

![](new-post.png)

---

# Location of New Post

The post will exist under the `content/post` folder.

![](new-post-file.png)

---

# Site Update

If you have your interactive session open, the site will automatically update with the post.

![](new-post-server.png)

---

# Deploying

1. When you are ready to publish your site, you can use the `build_site(local = FALSE)` function, which knits the Rmd files and runs Hugo to prepare your site for publication.

2. You will need to select a service for hosting your site. There are many options, like:
  - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
  - [Github IO](https://pages.github.com/)
  - [Updog](https://updog.co/)
  
3. When you have a domain, you will need to update `baseurl` in your config before running `build_site`.

# Useful Add-ons

1. Contact page

2. Comments

3. Google search

---

# Contact

For a simple page with your email contact, you can create a markdown file like so:

![](contact.png)

--

- Store under content/post

- Use the menu 'main' to make it appear on the main page menu

---

# Comments

Comments aren't the greatest thing the Internet has given us but you may still want feedback from readers on your site

- `Disqus` is a popular comment service provider

- Many Hugo themes like Mainroad provide automatic support

- Just register your page there and then update your config.toml

<br>

<div style="margin-left:15%;">
<img src="disquis.png" width=80% />
</div>

---

# Google Search

- Once you are building content, it is a good idea to give your readers the ability to search content on your site

- One way to do this is with Google site search 

- Many themes will have built-in widgets to incorporate this search


<br>
<br>
<br>

*Note:* It can take a day or so for the site index to begin to populate

---

# Search Configuration

![](search-config.png)

---

# Search Widget

Under layouts/partials/widgets in Mainroad theme...

![](search-widget.png)

---

# Embedding Visuals

.pull-left[
<br>
<br>
<br>

- `img src` for local images

- `iframe` for third party images
]

.pull-right[
![](rainbow.gif)
]

---

# Static

- Sometimes you might create an image outside of R markdown that you want to include on your site

- You can store these under 'public/img'

- These can then be invoked with standard 'img src'

<br>
<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}
<div style="float:right;padding:2%;">
<img src="/img/my_image.png" width=30% />
</div>
```

---

# Third Party Images

These are images that exist on the Web. Some common types you might consider including are:

- Getty images

- Plotly charts

- Entire shiny apps!

--

- All of this can be done with iframes
